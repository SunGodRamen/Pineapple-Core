Ticket 1: Set Up Tauri with Rust Backend
X Navigate to your project root.
X Initialize Tauri using tauri init.
X Update the Tauri configuration as needed (e.g., application name, window dimensions).
X Test the Tauri setup by running tauri dev.

Ticket 2: Expose file_browser Functionality to JS
X Modify file_browser.rs to expose a function, e.g.,  list_files_in_directory(path: &str) -> Vec<String>.
In src-tauri/src/main.rs, add the Tauri command handler to handle the JS call and route to the list_files_in_directory function.
Return the file list to the JS caller.

Ticket 3: Expose file_launcher Functionality to JS
Modify file_launcher.rs to expose a function, e.g., open_file(path: &str, app: Option<&str>).
In src-tauri/src/main.rs, add the Tauri command handler to handle the JS call and route to the open_file function.
Handle possible errors and return success/failure status to the JS caller.

Ticket 4: Develop the File Browser GUI
Design the basic HTML/CSS layout for the file browser in index.html and styles.css.
Add JavaScript in main.js to:
Call the Rust function to list files when a directory is selected.
Display the list of files in the GUI.
Open a file when clicked or when a specific action is taken.
Ensure the JS correctly handles the data returned from Rust and provides appropriate feedback to the user.

Ticket 5: Additional Features and Polish
Add icons/thumbnails for different file types.
Implement a search or filter functionality for the file list.
Add error handling and user feedback for potential issues (e.g., directory not found, file not opening).
Optimize the GUI responsiveness and ensure it's working seamlessly with the backend.

Ticket 6: Testing and Documentation
Thoroughly test the application for various scenarios:
Different directory structures.
Opening files with and without specific apps.
Handling invalid paths or inaccessible directories.
Document the functionalities and possible edge cases.
Create a user manual or guide if needed.
